> al: Hi there!

- What’s going on here? **WhatsGoingOn**
- Can you beam me down back to the park? **BeamingDownRequest**
- Is this an actual spaceship? **ActualSpaceship**
- Bye! *Stop*

# Stop
> ian: Don't touch anything!

# WhatsGoingOn
> al: Oh, we're just removing all the tech nerds from this planet.
> ian: Yeah, we don't need any super intelligence popping up here!

- But we're decades away from realizing full Artifical General Intelligence! *SuperIntelligence*

# SuperIntelligence
> al: I know, but Ian isn't convinced.
> ian: Those Azure data centers are doing something!

- But they're just mining BitCoin! **AzureBitCoin**
- But they're just running Bot code for 8-bit adventure games! **AzureAdventureGames**
- But, but... *AzureGiveUp*

# AzureBitCoin
> al: You can probably make more money by just trading!
> ian: I'm not buying it!

# AzureAdventureGames
> al: Nice try!
> ian: Nobody plays adventure games anymore!

# AzureGiveUp
> player: I guess I can't convince you.

# BeamingDownRequest
> al: Sure!
> ian: NO WAY!
> ian: We need to get everything on the list!

- Please? **NoBeamingDown**
- Pretty please? **NoBeamingDown**
- Pretty please with a cherry on top? **NoBeamingDown**
- I give up… *GiveUpBeamingDown*
