This repo contains a game-engine for an old-skool 8 bit adventure game. The game was inspired by games from the eighties and nineties like Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Full Trhottle, Grim Fandango ,etecetera.

The engine contains 2 parts: a front-end part ("the game") and a back-end part (the "engine"). 

## Front-end
The front-end is a Javascript (Typescript) based engine built on top of the Phaser HTML5 game framework.

## Back-end
The back-end is built on top of the Microsoft Bot framework.

This is a work in progress and more info will follow soon!
